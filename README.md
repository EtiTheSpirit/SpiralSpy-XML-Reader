#A Java version of this code will soon be released!

#MainHandler.lua is, since this is ROBLOX and items have parent instances and child instances,inside of the main code (Spiral Knights Model Converter.lua)

#This code does NOT function in Lua 5.1, only ROBLOX's sandboxed version of Lua 5.1 -- It contains custom preset functions and vars (like "script", or Instance.new())
